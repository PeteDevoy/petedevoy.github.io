            Welcome traveller.
        <p>
            This website is an attempt to catalogue some of my projects and play time.
        <p>
            I have ADHD and sometimes start projects to scratch an itch, only later to abandon them because something more interesting comes along.
        <p>
            My old self might have been embarassed of this and excluded such project from this website but I now see them as trophies of my rhizomic learning style; I hope you will too.
        <p>
            Enjoy what you find here :&rbbrk;
