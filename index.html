            Welcome traveller,
        <p>
            This website is an attempt to catalogue some of my projects and play.
        <p>
            I have ADHD and sometimes start projects to scratch an itch, only later to abandon them because something more interesting comes along&hellip;
        <p>
            My old self might have been embarassed of this and excluded such endeavours from this website but I now see them as trophies of my rhizomic learning style; I hope you will too.
        <p>
            Enjoy whatever you may find here :&rbbrk;
