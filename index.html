            Welcome traveler,
        <p>
            This website is an attempt to catalogue some of my projects and play.  It is a work in progress as I have quite the backlog to work through.
        <p>
            I have ADHD and sometimes start projects to scratch an itch, only later to abandon them because something more interesting comes along&hellip;
        <p>
            In that respect, this portfolio is more a showcase of my rhizomatic learning style rather than one of polished works.
        <p>
            Enjoy whatever you may find here :&rbbrk;
