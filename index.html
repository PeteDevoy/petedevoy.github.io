            Welcome traveler,
        <p>
            This website is an attempt to catalogue some of my projects and play.  It is a work in progress as I have quite the backlog to work through.
        <p>
            I have ADHD and sometimes start projects to scratch an itch, only later to abandon them because something more interesting comes along&hellip;
        <p>
            My old self might have been embarrassed of this and excluded such endeavors from this website but I now see them as trophies of my rhizomatic learning style; I hope you will too.
        <p>
            Enjoy whatever you may find here :&rbbrk;
