      <h1>BritishNationalGrid.uk – Coordinate Conversion and Tile Reference Tool</h1>
      <p>
        A long-running web app designed to support the British geospatial community with a lightweight tool for coordinate conversion and spatial referencing. It offers a clean, browser-based way to explore the British National Grid, convert between coordinate formats, and better understand the informal quadrant-based tile naming convention often used in large raster datasets.

    <h2>Why I Built It</h2>
    <p>
      Running my geospatial software consultancy business, 3XE Ltd, gave me a professional interest in improving clarity
      around the way spatial data is subdivided and referenced in the UK. While standard OS grid references and coordinate
      transformations are well-served by existing tools, the ‘cardinal quadrant’ notation — such as <code>SS10NW</code> or <code>SU97SE</code> — 
      is often encountered in academic and professional datasets without much explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      BritishNationalGrid.uk helps users visualise and work with that system more intuitively, whether they’re identifying files for aerial
      imagery, working with map tiles, or teaching the structure of the grid.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a concrete example: an aerial survey dataset might contain a file named <code>SU97NE.tiff</code>, referring to the northeastern quadrant
      of the 10km square SU97 — which includes Windsor Castle. But the 5km square directly to the east of SU97NE won't appear adjacent in a list of files in the dataset.
      Rather, it belongs to a different 10km and 100km tile and is named <code>TQ07NW.tiff</code>. This is the kind of nuance that BritishNationalGrid.uk is designed to clarify at a glance.
    </p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Convert between easting/northing, OS grid references, and WGS84 lat/lon</li>
      <li>Interactive overlay of the national grid on Ordnance Survey mapping</li>
      <li>Visualisation and handling of 5km quadrant suffixes (e.g. NW, SE, etc.)</li>
      <li>Keyboard shortcuts and copy-friendly formatting for ease of use</li>
      <li>Optimised for fast loading and responsive use across devices</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Longevity and Adoption</h2>
    <p>
      The app has grown steadily since launch, with no marketing beyond word of mouth. It now serves around 600 visits per day, with a portion of those being daily returning users — many of whom appear to rely on it as part of their regular workflows.
    </p>
    <p>
      One recent piece of feedback simply read: “Excellent!” — and in many ways, that quietly appreciative tone reflects the project’s goal.
    </p>

    <h2>What It Represents</h2>
    <p>
      This is one of several small tools I’ve built to make spatial information more accessible. It reflects a broader interest in simplifying geospatial workflows and building interfaces that feel purposeful rather than overwhelming — particularly in contexts where clarity matters more than feature depth.
