            <h1>Demo DJ Mix for Open Call</h1>
            <p>A DJ collective in Poland called Miazmat did an open call and I put this mix together as my submisssion. I tried new things with imperfect but pleasing results.</p>

            <h2>The Mix</h2>

            <h2>My Approach (and deviations)</h2>
            <p>
            Normally I'm mixing, breaks, UKG and Drum 'n' Bass but I was inspired by the energy in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asBkswg4q4I" target="_blank">&quot;DJ snow&quot; video</a> to mix some bass house.
            <p>
            I was tipped off the collective gets bored hearing the same style transitions so I deviated from my norm of playing it safe a little. Instead, I tried a tighter mixing style with greater variety of transitions, including some rooted in FX.
            <h2>The Outcome</h2>
            <p>
            Ultimately, Miazmat had ~135 submissions for their open call and only 4 slots on the line-up.  They said they would dip into the submissions again when organising future events so fingers crossed I'll get to play with them one day.
            <h2>Reflections</h2>
            <p>
            In retrospect it was probably a bit of gamble to try too many new things for a demo mix hence a result that is a little rough around the edges.  For instance, I realised upon playback of the recording that, at some point, I'd accidentally disabled the &quot;MASTER TEMPO&quot;/&quot;pitch lock&quot; feature on my DJ system after which the pitch of some tracks shifted during beatmatching.  Oops.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
            Despite the odd mistake and indeterminate outcome of the submission, I wanted to push myself to things outside of my comfort zone and I'm glad to say, in that respect, I succeeded.
