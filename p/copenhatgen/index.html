            Imagine going to a country music festival in Copenhagen, thematically dressed in your fancy rancher hat only to have wild wind of the Øresund blow it right off of your head.
        <p>
            It is precisely what happened to my friend and, when she told me, I couldn't help but think that the story itself sounded like the subject of a country song.
        <p>
            Naturally, ChatGPT wrote the lyrics for me and I used Suno.com to generate the song.

        <section class="lyrics">
            [Verse]
            <p>
                In the heart of Copenhagen, where the wind blows strong,<br>
                I wore my favorite hat, but the wind had plans all along,<br>
                It caught a gust of freedom, soared into the sky,<br>
                I chased it down those cobblestone streets, oh my, oh my.
            </p>
            
            [Chorus]
            <p>
                My hat went flyin', in that Danish breeze,<br>
                Through the city of bikes and dreams, it danced with ease,<br>
                Oh, Copenhagen, you took my hat away,<br>
                But the memories we made, they're here to stay.
            </p>
            
            [Verse]
            <p>
                Underneath the pastel sky, by the canals so wide,<br>
                I watched my hat pirouette, like a restless bride,<br>
                Amongst the vibrant tulips, it found a new friend,<br>
                In that whimsical moment, my heart began to mend.
            </p>
            
            [Chorus]
            <p>
                My hat went flyin', in that Danish breeze,<br>
                Through the city of bikes and dreams, it danced with ease,<br>
                Oh, Copenhagen, you took my hat away,<br>
                But the memories we made, they're here to stay.
            </p>
            
            [Bridge]
            <p>
                In this land of legends, where old meets new,<br>
                My hat found freedom, as if it always knew,<br>
                It whispered tales of love, in the language of the wind,<br>
                In this Nordic adventure, my lost hat did begin.
            </p>
            
            [Chorus]
            <p>
                My hat went flyin', in that Danish breeze,<br>
                Through the city of bikes and dreams, it danced with ease,<br>
                Oh, Copenhagen, you took my hat away,<br>
                But the memories we made, they're here to stay.
            </p>
            
            [Outro]
            <p>
                Though my hat has flown, to a distant place,<br>
                I'll always remember, that wind-kissed chase,<br>
                Oh, Copenhagen, you left a mark so grand,<br>
                In the fabric of my story, forever it'll stand.
            </p>
