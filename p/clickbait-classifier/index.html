            <p>A logistic regression model for classifying clickbait headlines with CLI and HTTP interface which accepts text or a YouTube URL.</p>

        <p>
            I had the idea to write a browser extension that would hide YouTube videos with clickbait titles and built this simple Python app as a
            proof-of-concept of the core functionality.
        <p>
            The app uses a logistic regression model trained using bag-of-words features extracted from a labeled dataset of clickbait headlines found publicly online.
        <p>
            I was afraid bag-of-words would be a bit of a blunt tool for the job but I was happily surprised with the model's performance. That said, if this were a serious project, I would invest time into using complex feature extraction methods and additional tuning.

            If you're willing to wait for the server to spin up, the classifier can be tested live <a href="https://clickbait-classifier.onrender.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
        <p>
            The code to train the model and run the app is available <a href="https://github.com/PeteDevoy/clickbait-classifier/" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>.
