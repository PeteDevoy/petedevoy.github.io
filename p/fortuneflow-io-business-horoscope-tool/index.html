            <h1>FortuneFlow.io – Business Horoscope Generator</h1>
            <p>
                An ongoing project exploring how astrological symbolism might be reinterpreted for professional contexts. FortuneFlow generates business-themed horoscopes based on a user’s role, birth details, and (optionally) current location. The result is a personalised reading that blends astronomical data with AI-generated narrative.

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            The backend calculates planetary positions using Swiss Ephemeris and feeds that into a custom prompt for a large language model. On the front-end, there’s location autocomplete (via Geoapify), geolocation support, and form persistence to create a smooth and intuitive user experience.
        </p>

        <h2>What I’m Exploring</h2>
        <p>
            This project sits at the intersection of narrative design, technical implementation, and venture building. I’m exploring how interpretive tools — traditionally associated with personal introspection — can be adapted to support reflection and strategic thinking in a business setting.
        </p>
        <p>
            From a commercial perspective, I’m testing whether there’s a viable market for tools that offer personalised insight without falling into generic self-help language. The goal isn’t to replicate astrology wholesale, but to reframe its symbolic richness in a way that resonates with professionals — particularly founders and decision-makers who value perspective, pattern recognition, and psychological framing.
        </p>

        <h2>Where It’s At</h2>
        <p>
            The prototype is live and evolving. I’m iterating on prompt design, observing user engagement, and considering how this could grow into a broader offering — whether as a standalone product or as a component within a larger toolkit for business reflection and planning.
