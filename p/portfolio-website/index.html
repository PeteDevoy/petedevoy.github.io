            <h1>Portfolio Website</h1>
            <p>Enclosing my share of cyberspace to catalogue my endeavours.</p>

            This page offers a brief overview of the decisions I made when choosing the approach and stack (or lack thereof) for this very website.    
        <h2>KISS Won</h2>
            <p>
                Ultimately, I opted to construct this site using straightforward HTML, CSS, and frontend JavaScript*
            <p>
                I must say it's a joy to be living in the age of Web Components and the Fetch API.  Together they make code reuse painless :&rbbrk;

                <summary>*Dirty Secret</summary>
                <p>
                    TypeScript is nice but I find developing without a build step more fun.  I feel like I enjoy JavaScript in the same way some people enjoy free climbing.  At least for a project like this one.

        <h2>Considered alternatives</h2>
        <h3>Wordpress/Other CMS</h3>
        <h4>Reasons For</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Structure</li>
            <li>SEO</li>
            <li>Set-up speed</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Reasons Against</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Would need to code plugins to display certain things in the way I desire</li>
            <li>Hack-magnet if self-hosted</li>
            <li>Limitations of a blog-light structure</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Neo4j-backed Solution</h3>
        <h4>Reasons For</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Opportunity to play more with graph databases</li>
            <li>Flexible sufacing of data and relationships</li>
            <li>Opportunity to create something more unique/special</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Reasons Against</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Serving content from a database creates new security concerns</li>
            <li>The stack becomes more complicated</li>
            <li>No viable CMS means I would have to code my display and query logic</li>
            <li>Leaning curve presents a project risk; I could waste time building a custom CMS instead of getting my content on the web</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Static Site Generator</h3>
        <h4>Reasons For</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Advantages of dynamic content with static hosting</li>
            <li>Correct framework</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Reasons Against</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>There are multiple to choose from; learning takes time.</li>
            <li>Build process would become more complex.</li>
            <li>Attaching external framework too early in this project could be a vector for code rot.</li>
        </ul>
